Script_biblioteca.py 📚

Welcome toScript_biblioteca.py, This is my first Python script, created with love (and a bit of sweat) during the Python introductory course organized by Bejob 2025. If you're here, you're probably interested in programming, books, or you just got lost on GitHub. In any case, stick around for a while! 😄

📖 What's up?
This script is a small library manager that allows you to do the following:

1️⃣ Add a book
2️⃣ Lend a book
3️⃣ Return a book
4️⃣ Show available books
5️⃣ Search for a book
6️⃣ Exit (when life calls)

Basically, it does the bare minimum you'd expect from a library manager: add, lend, and return books. It runs in text mode and doesn't save data, so every time you close it, everything vanishes into oblivion. Don't expect it to revolutionize your life, but it helped me pass the course and practice what I learned. 📚💻

Installation and usage
Make sure you have Python installed (if you don't, go install it now!).

Download the script.

Open it on your favorite IDE.

Run the command:

bash
Copy
Script_biblioteca.pyo.py
Thanks and happy coding! 🖥📚
